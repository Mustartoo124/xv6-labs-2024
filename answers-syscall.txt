1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
syscall was call by usertrap() in kernel/trap.c, line 67

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7
That number represents for SYS_exec system call

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
user mode, as the SPP bit is 0

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
lw	s2,0(zero)
Register s2 corresponds to the variable num

5. Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
The kernel crash due to the fault in loading page, in the xv6, address 0 is not mapped in the kernel address space, as the loader loads the xv6 kernel into memory at physical address 0x80000000. 

6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
Name of the running binary is 'initcode'
pid = 1
